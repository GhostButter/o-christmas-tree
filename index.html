			There are tent cities everywhere in the world but here in hawaii we have them to but not all of them are bad, some can be really out of the way from citizens that are just passing by, and some of them go by it really smart, like one of them that is really big here where everyone has a part to do, like chores and just protecting the tent city.But lots of the camps are right in the sidewalk for lots of citizens walking by, like the one by dolle shopping center where there are just a whole ton of homeless there,but we can help the by getting them into different shelters like institute for human services, Waikiki Health’s next step shelter, and HOPE services hawaii inc. But reasons why the homeless don’ t go into the shelters are for one the have rules that they don’t like so they go out of there in a couple of days,two their family doesn't fit all in the tiny space that they have there, and three some people might not like the people there and get into big arguments about something. Some miscommunication about the homeless are they’re just lazy bums that don’t do any work, thus is false because a lot of them acutely do work one two our even three jobs at once just to stay alive, another one is that they all do drugs, this is also false because a lot of the just messed up in the past and are trying to get where they used to be.You can help by donating your time and money to any of the many homeless charities that are here in hawaii like Project hawaii,IHS, and helping hands hawaii, but try not to give the homeless your money because if you give it to the wrong person the may just buy more drugs or alcohol.
